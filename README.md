Student performance depends on a mix of academic, social, and personal factors. Not all 
variables are equally informative, and including too many can add noise, increase model 
complexity, and make results harder to interpret. 

This analysis aims to predict secondary-level students’ final mathematics grade (G3) while 
identifying the features that matter most. Two methods are used to select important variables 
and focus the model on meaningful predictors, making it simpler and easier to understand 
which factors affect student performance.
